## 1 Overview

The purpose of this project was to conduct a weather analysis for the island of Oahu to potentially start a Surf and Shake Shop - serving surfboards and icecream to locals and tourists. However, to get some real investor backing to get the business off the ground, W. Avy was excited in the possibility in partnering together. One concern he had was the weather and asked that we conduct an analysis on a weather dataset he has from Oahu to determine if the island is indeed the ideal location for the shop.

To determine if the surf and shake shop would be sustainable year round, W Avy asked that we analyze two months - June and December. Based on the results, the following information can be derived:

- the month of June had 183 more observations than the month of December (1700 in June vs. 1517 in December)
- the mean temperature for the month of June was 74.9 degrees, whereas December's was 71.0
- the minimum temperature for the month of June was 64 degrees and December was 56 degrees
- the maximum temperature for the month of June was 83 degrees and December was 85 degrees

## 3 Summary

Overall, based on the results, Oahu is a good fit to run a sustainable, year round surf and shake shop.
